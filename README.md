# toyos


I decided I would try my hand in writing a simple toy OS after my father in law gave me a old Compaq Portable 386. The goal of this project is learn more about operating systems while hopefully having some fun. 

Right now it only boots into protected mode and prints "Hello, World!" to both the screen and out the serial device.
